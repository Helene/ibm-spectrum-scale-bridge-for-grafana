# Example dashboards

Example dashboards can easily be imported in a running Grafana environment.
Follow these [instructions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/reference/export_import/) to import your preferred dashboard into your Grafana installation.
The Grafana provisioning feature might be helpful, if you are going to import multiple dashboards. For more info please read [Make usage of Grafana Provisioning feature](https://github.com/IBM/ibm-spectrum-scale-bridge-for-grafana/wiki/Make-usage-of-Grafana-Provisioning-feature)


Between version 9.0 and 9.5, Grafana has significantly redesigned the dashboard panels.
For more information, see the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v9-5/?plcmt=learn-nav#redesigned-dashboard-panel -is- generally available)
Therefore, it is highly recommended to use at least the Grafana 9.5 version.
